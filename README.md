## 2D Game library

Well... this repository started just as a simple implementation of a 2D top-to-bottom game, but a few commits later I started to generalized the classes and methods so they can work in a variaty of exaples.
This is yet a big IN PROGRES but a project that I found really interesting, by the end I'll make a few implementations (2D games) and a wiki explaining how to use these 'library'.
